[Announcer: Jeff Bass]
This is another public service announcement
Brought to you, in part, by Slim Shady
(Tell 'em I don't give a fuck)
Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think
(Tell 'em to suck it)
If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know, upon purchasing this album, you have just kissed his ass
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)
Slim Shady is fed up with your shit, and he's going to kill you
Uh... anything else?

[Eminem]
Yeah... sue me!
Em’s follow-up Public Service Announcement to the Slim Shady LP version mocks censorship and prepares the listener for the next 72 minutes of offensive lyrical acrobatics.
