Ayo, Paul. It's Em, I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wowa, well I'll show him who's really bad
*Burps*
Paul the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror and tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough
Do you remember the time we were watching the Billie Jean video
Well he'll always be that Michael to me and it doesn't matter if he's black or white cause I can't stop loving him and I hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking die
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna touch him... but I can't
*Mouth noises*
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit
Sorry, anyways call me back
I have this idea on how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no I don't have a new gun
Goddamn it
