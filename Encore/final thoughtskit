[People chanting Eminem]

[Paper folding/tearing]

[Footsteps]

[Door open and slam shut]

[More footsteps]

[Eminem]
I almost forgot
You're comin' with me

[Gun reloading]

[Eminem]
That's him baby, let's go
That's him baby, let's go
That's him baby, let's go

[sigh]
The skit leading into the final track on Eminem’s Encore album. Very suspenseful.
